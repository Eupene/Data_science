# Health Insurance Premium Prediction and Utilization Analysis

This project develops a predictive model to assist a health insurance organization in accurately determining the premium to charge subscribers. The objective is to minimize risks, maximize profitability, and identify potential low-cost subscribers.

---

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Health insurance organizations face challenges in determining appropriate premiums due to variability in subscriber expenses. Current approaches often lead to:
- **Undercharging high-expense subscribers**, resulting in losses.
- **Overcharging low-expense subscribers**, deterring potential customers.

This project aims to build a predictive model capable of:
- **Estimating the total cost (utilization)** for a subscriber based on their characteristics.
- **Identifying least-cost subscribers** to optimize profit margins.

### Objectives
1. **Predict Utilization**: Estimate the total expenses incurred by a subscriber.
2. **Premium Recommendation**: Determine appropriate premiums based on risk profiles.
3. **Subscriber Segmentation**: Identify low-cost subscribers for targeted marketing.
