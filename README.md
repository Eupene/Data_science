Health Insurance Premium Prediction and Utilization Analysis
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assist a health insurance organization in accurately determining the premium to charge subscribers. The objective is to minimize risks, maximize profitability, and identify potential low-cost subscribers.

Project Overview
Problem Statement
Health insurance organizations face challenges in determining appropriate premiums due to variability in subscriber expenses. Current approaches often lead to:

Undercharging high-expense subscribers, resulting in losses.
Overcharging low-expense subscribers, deterring potential customers.
The goal is to build a predictive model capable of:

Estimating the total cost (utilization) for a subscriber based on their characteristics.
Identifying least-cost subscribers to optimize profit margins.
Objectives
Predict Utilization: Predict the total expenses incurred by a subscriber.
Premium Recommendation: Determine appropriate premiums based on risk profiles.
Subscriber Segmentation: Identify low-cost subscribers for targeted marketing.
